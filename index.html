                <h2>About Fleet Foxes</h2>
                <p>Fleet Foxes are usually labelled indie folk, a genre that came up in the 1990s when indie rock musicians used folk music traditions, such as acoustic guitar melodies, with contemporary rock music sounds. The pop sensibilities that they bring to their albums and performances make the Foxes' music stand out.</p>
                <p>The band was formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold, Skyler Skjelset, Casey Wescott, Christian Wargo, and Morgan Henderson. Fleet Foxes came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their eponymous debut album on Sub Pop.</p>

                <h2>Here is a quote about Fleet Foxes from Sanjoy Narayan</h2>
                <blockquote cite="https://lifestyle.livemint.com/how-to-lounge/art-culture/opinion-fleet-foxes-are-comfort-food-for-your-ears-111634531899467.html">
                    <em>Like comfort food, welcome and uplifting in times of stress, you can feel a sense of well-being gently wafting over you as you listen to Fleet Foxes’ new album, Shore.
                     It’s not that the band, led by frontman and lead singer Robin Pecknold, always sings happy and upbeat songs—Fleet Foxes’ songs almost always have an aura of melancholia about 
                     them but there is something about the way they inject their brand of indie folk music with pop that makes their songs comforting and calming.</em>
