                <h2>About Fleet Foxes</h2>
                <p>Fleet Foxes are usually labelled indie folk, a genre that came up in the 1990s when indie rock musicians used folk music traditions, such as acoustic guitar melodies, with contemporary rock music sounds. The pop sensibilities that they bring to their albums and performances make the Foxes' music stand out.</p>
                <p>The band was formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold, Skyler Skjelset, Casey Wescott, Christian Wargo, and Morgan Henderson. Fleet Foxes came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their eponymous debut album on Sub Pop.</p>
